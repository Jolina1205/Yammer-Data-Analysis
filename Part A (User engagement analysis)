ASSIGNMENT 

-- Tables used
select * from tutorial.yammer_users
select * from tutorial.yammer_events
select * from tutorial.yammer_emails
select * from benn.dimension_rollup_periods -- We didn't understood how this table (periods) is related


-- 1) customer engagement  (emails dataset)


select DISTINCT user_id , count(case when action = 'sent_weekly_digest' then 1 else null end) as sent_weekly_digest,
count(case when action = 'email_open' then 1 else null end) as email_open ,
count(case when action = 'email_clickthrough' then 1 else null end) as email_clickthrough,
count(case when action = 'sent_email_reengagement' then 1 else null end) as sent_email_reengagement
from tutorial.yammer_emails user_id group by user_id order by user_id

-- Insights : Yammer is not sending any reengagement email to the users that are less frequent in engaging with the website
-- solution : Yammer can send more reengaging emails so that it can increase it's potential user engagement

--2) Neglected active users   (email, users dataset)

select users.user_id ,users.state, case when email.action is null then 'Mail not send' end as new_action
from tutorial.yammer_users users left join tutorial.yammer_emails email
on  users.user_id = email.user_id and email.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' 
where users.state = 'active' and email.action is null  group by 1,2, email.action order by 1

-- Insights : These are the users that are active but no email is send to them 
-- Solution : Yammer can send them emails like other active users and hence increase their engagement


--3) Marketing according to language preference (users dataset)
Select language, COUNT(*) AS count FROM tutorial.yammer_users GROUP BY language ORDER BY count DESC

-- Insights : Maximum users prefer "English" language
-- Solution : Yammer can prefer doing maximum of their marketing in English


--4) Target companies (users dataset)

select DISTINCT company_id , count(user_id)  from tutorial.yammer_users where state= 'active'
group by company_id order by count desc limit 20

-- Insights : This gives the top 10 companies according to maximum no. of users that are active
-- Solution : Yammer should focus more on these companies having maximum active users 


--5) Segmentation based on event_type (events dataset)

select user_id, count (case when event_type ='engagement' then 1 else null end) as engagement , 
count(case when event_type ='signup_flow' then 1 else null end) as sign_up
from tutorial.yammer_events group by user_id order by user_id

-- Insights : The users that have 'engagement' as their event type actually use the website for some purpose.
--            The signup flow users just sign up and don't do any other significant task on the website
-- Solution : Yammer can focus more on users who have more of egagement event_type than the signup flow type 


--6) Time (UTC) showing maximum traffic (events dataset)

GROUP BY hour ORDER BY event_count DESC LIMIT 10

-- Insights : 10 AM is the time when maximum events are carried out on the website throughout the globe 
--            Top 10 Max traffic times are given here
-- Solution : Yammer can make sure that during these times , the website doesn't encounter with any issue .
