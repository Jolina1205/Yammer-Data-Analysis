PROBLEM STATEMENT : Yammer wants to update it's search engine , but before that they want to know whether this time investment is worth it or not.


/* Hypothetical situations that can show if the search engine is worth working on 
1.	Saving time for searching the entire concept they wish to view
2.	Guessing & Recommending not just the thing they are searching but other similar things too
3.	How often the user choose from the recommended list
4.	Does the search engine motivates the user to explore more stuff other than what he/she is searching
5.	Are the recommendations arranged according to the most relevant stuff
6.	Are the recommendations entirely based on userâ€™s search history , or the search engine includes other than that too
7.	After typing how many characters the user is getting the right recommendation
8.	Is there a picture / audio search available to save more time 
9.	If the user navigate through different recommendations then there is a possibility that the user is not getting the desired results in the top most recommendation
10.	How likely is it that the user uses the advance search engine */

/* Tables used :
1.	tutorial.yammer_users
2.	tutorial.yammer_events */

-- 1) Is the recommendation system useful to max users (events dataset)

select event_name , count(*) as count from tutorial.yammer_events where event_name ='search_autocomplete' 
or event_name= 'search_run' group by event_name order by count desc

-- Insights : Here count of search_autocomplete is significantly more as compared to search_run count
--            This indicates that max users get what they are looking for in the recommendation list itself 
-- Solution : Yammer can work better on the search engine to offer more relevent suggesions to it's users


-- 2) Most relevent search appearance at which position (events dataset)

select event_name , count(*) as count from tutorial.yammer_events where event_name ilike '%search_click%'
group by event_name order by count desc

-- Insights : This query gives the positions at which a most relevent recommendation occures 
--            Here , recommendations occuring at positions are the highest clicked through ones , followed ny 1 , 4 ,3 ....
-- Solution : It looks like yammers search is working good in this context. Yammer don't need to work more on it .


-- 3) For which language preference does the system gives most of the relevent suggessions (users , events dataset)

SELECT users.language, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM tutorial.yammer_users users  LEFT JOIN  tutorial.yammer_events event ON users.user_id = event.user_id
WHERE users.state = 'active' AND event.event_name = 'search_autocomplete'
GROUP BY users.language ORDER BY count DESC

-- Insights : This query shows that English is the preference language which gives the best recommendations to the users.
--            It gives the count of search_autocomplete for each language preference opted by active users
-- Solution : Yammer can work on giving better suggesions for other languages that have less count of relevent recommendation
--            for eg Korean , Italian ....


-- 4) According to device (users & events dataset)

SELECT event.device, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM tutorial.yammer_users users  RIGHT JOIN  tutorial.yammer_events event ON users.user_id = event.user_id
WHERE users.state = 'active' AND event.event_name = 'search_autocomplete'
GROUP BY event.device ORDER BY count DESC

-- Insights : Here macbook pro has the highest count of active users who find the recommender system useful , followed by lonovo thinkpad ...
--            This shows that users using these devices have better recommendations as compared to others.
-- Solution : Yammer can find the root cause of this issue and can work to provide more relevently for other device users too ,
--            and also the similar device users that will be a part of yammmer


-- 5) According to Company_id (users & events dataset)

SELECT users.company_id, COUNT(*) AS total_events , count(case when event.event_name ='search_autocomplete' then event.event_name end)as is_relevent,
count(case when event.event_name ='search_run' then event.event_name end)as is_not_relevent
FROM tutorial.yammer_users users  LEFT JOIN  tutorial.yammer_events event ON users.user_id = event.user_id
WHERE users.state = 'active'  
GROUP BY users.company_id ORDER BY total_events DESC

-- Insights : This shows the companies according to the no.of events carried out by them on yammer in desc order 
--            It also shows the count of how many the the search engine were useful to them & otherwise
-- Solution : Yammer can work on and find the issues faced by those companies who find the recommendations less relatable  and end up typing the entire query they wish to view
